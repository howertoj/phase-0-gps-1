git clone: created a local repository mirroring what's on GitHub for us to work with on our systems.

touch: creates a file with whatever name and type the user determines. 

ls: lists contents of the active directory.

git init: initializes version control through git for the active/open folder.

git status: checks status of the git repository. Tells user what branch they're on, status of any files/modifications to files in the directory.

git branch: checks what branch the repo is on. 

git checkout -b: used to create a new branch, in this case "add-comand-log". Also jumps over to the new branch. 

touch (2nd file): created a new file called README.md (this one) in the repo.
